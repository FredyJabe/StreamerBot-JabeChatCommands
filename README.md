# StreamerBot-JabeChatCommands

A little command system to use with [`Streamerbot`](https://streamer.bot/) to grow your stream as easily and simply as possible!

## What does it do?
The system let's the streamer creates new chat commands as easily as creating a new text file! Also enables SFXs and GFXs to be added as simply as a new file in a folder.

## Which platform can I use that with?
Currently, it's only setup to work with Twitch, but I can easily make some changes to enable Youtube too, if interest there is.

## How can I use that?
It's super simple to use, create 5 actions with a single `Execute C# Code` sub-action in all of them! For the C# that you'll need, every file in the repo represents an action, so simply copy-paste what you want! Now we need to link these Actions with actual events, to do so, simply go the the Platforms tab and assign your actions to their respective events!

Screenshots, import codes and more information coming soon
